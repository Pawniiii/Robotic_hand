# Robotic_hand
Wield voice modulation to operate and make movements
Applications of internet of things are pulled off along with following components:
arduino ide
blurtooth module
android application
servo motors
laser teared model
arduino board
bread board
It take input signal through google assistant present on android application(AMR_VOICE). The code for this development was written in c++ language on Arduino IDE. Once the code is compiled it is transferred on Arduino board. From here multiple connections are made using the components and google assistant is used through the android app for transferring the messages from app to HC05 to Arduino and respective output is performed.
